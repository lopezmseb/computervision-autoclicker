3. Another window will pop-up and ask you to select the **Confidence Level** (how pixel perfect the comparison is)
4. A final window will pop-up explaining how to pause and quit.
5. Once you exit the window, your mouse should start moving to the selected image's location on your screen. This means the program is working.
